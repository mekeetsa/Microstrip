# Microstrip Impedance Calculator

Microstrip is one topology used to provide trace-controlled impedance on a PCB for digital circuits. Microstrip lines are exposed to both air and a dielectric referenced to a planar structure. Purpose of this notebook is to be used to calulate impedance and differential impedance of the microstrip topology. Sample calculations are provided for 90 and 100 Ohm differential impedance in standard 4-layer PCB stackup.
